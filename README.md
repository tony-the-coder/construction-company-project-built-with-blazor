# LehmanCustomConstruction
Being used a test push right now with all of the issues I had with the clean architecture and switching back. I started the 
other project because of an issue with this one, just a login issue that all my testing, searching, and copilot help, the login would not work
after over 20 hours rebuilding everything in my clean-architecture project, that whole project just randomly crashed. I should have just
tried to fix this project.
